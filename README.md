# Crush Crime vibes-site

This is a site built to demonstrate what a 'clinical' look for the Crush Crime campaign could look like, which prioritises converting the 'dissenter at their own dinner table', Guardian-reading, Islingtonian. 

It leads with the individual campaigns -- Repeat offenders, court backlogs, and Grooming Gangs. The demo site is visible here: https://crush-crime.vercel.app/

# Tech

It is built with Vite + React, using Tailwind and Shadcn components. The components and styles are set up and can be edited according to the guides here: https://ui.shadcn.com/. This means that it is very fast to add more content or components in the same style. 

A basic understanding of CSS + Tailwind is desirable when working with this site -- bear in mind that *LLMs are surprisingly bad at CSS* so some manual tweaking will be needed if one intends to vibecode changes. 

The site is not functional and is not mobile-optimised. The buttons do not work. It is a **demonstration only**.
